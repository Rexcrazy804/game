# Pink Pong
A simple, aesthetically pleasing pong game, written in c++ leveraging the SFML library.
this is quite an old project, decided to revive it with the power of the nix build system.

# Installation / How to play?
first get ![nix](https://nixos.org/).Then, run (ensure that nix flakes are enabled!) 
```bash
nix run github:Rexcrazy804/game
```
you may easily install the game by utilizing the nix profile command.

# Plans?
Presently I am not really think of much, I might tinker with the flake but presently I am a bit occupied.
But for when I do get time it would be great to implement these:
- Finish Implementing the ai
- Restart Screen
- maybe a settings button to change the colors?
