# Pink Pong
A simple, aesthetically pleasing pong game, written in c++ leveraging the SFML library.
this is quite an old project, decided to revive it with the power of the nix build system.

# Installation / How to play?
first get ![nix](https://nixos.org/). Then, run (you will probably need nixGL if not on nixOS) 
```bash
nix run github:Rexcrazy804/game
```
you may easily install the game by utilizing the nix profile command.

# Plans?
Presently I am not really thinking of much since I am a bit occupied, I might
tinker with the flake. But for when I do get time it would be great to
implement these:
- [x] ~Restart Screen~
- [ ] Finish Implementing the ai
- [ ] maybe a settings button to change the colors?
